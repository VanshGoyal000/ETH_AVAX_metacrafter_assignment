<h1>IN Module 1 </h1>
I create a contract named Ownership contract in which using some special functions like require(),revert(),assert()
in this code i made 3 functions in which i use require() so only owner can call this function.

revert is being used to get if caller is owner or not.

assert is also for same.

<h1>In Module 3</h1>
In mint function it is only mint by owner only using require we have to make condition.
but anyone can burn and transfer tokens. but in this we use require for condition amount > 0.
